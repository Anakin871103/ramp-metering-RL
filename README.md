# Call python in matlab

calibration_matlab.m is the main process, and get_cali_METANET.m is a function that calls function 'cali_METANET'.

1. Make sure the versions of MATLAB and PYTHON match.

2. cd to the current working path

3. If there is error "py not found", there are two possible reasons:
(1) The path or pyversion is wrong, MATLAB cannot find the function;
(2) There are some errors in the python script.
